<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span> his blog post will go over the importance of networking and strategies to develop your skills with a focus in sports. I recently accquired an internship with BYU Men's Basketball, and will be sharing the stratgies I used to land the position.</p>

## Networking
Like many industries, securing a job in the realm of sports analytics relies heavily on who and what you know. There are plenty of ways to make connections, you just have to know where to look!

Starting from scratch may seem intimidating, but meeting people who are working towards similar goals and those already in your dream job love to help out anyway they can. 

The first important connection I made was with one of the statisticians for the Sacramento Kings. By just sharing my interests with friends and family, I was able to meet someone who knew Zach, and was willing to give me his phone number. After speaking with him on the phone, I received useful advice for furthering my career in sports analytics. Just one connection has gone a long way!

# LinkedIn

Setting up a LinkedIn profile is important for any career path, and a perfect way to make connections with people who can help you further your career. LinkedIn provides a space for you to post your accomplishments in school, personal projects, and important career events. To start your profile, visit <a href="www.linkedin.com" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> to get started. 

Important sections to complete include:
- Profile picture and intro: Use a professional headshot for your profile picture. If you do not have one on hand, you can pose against a wall or any plain background. Your headshot only needs to include your shoulders and up, so smile! At the top of your profile, you will also want to fill out basic information to appear in your banner. You can edit the info at anytime using the pencil tool in the upper right corner.

- About: Share a brief message about your interests, goals, current projects, anything you would like to highlight!

- Experience: Even if you do not have a current job or internship, use this space to display your experience with companies you have previsouly worked with or volunteered for. Include a short description about your responsibilities, and fill in the skills section! Your company and connections can verify the skills on your profile for everyone to see!

- Education: Include your estimated graduation, activities or clubs you are a part of, and any other detail relevant to your time at school. Don't forget to include your skills again!

Once your profile is set up, it is time to make connections! Feel free to add anyone and everyone you know. Family, friends, roommates, professors! Expanding your range of connections will help you to unlock more potential job opportunities! You can also follow companies/schools, and they will appear under the interests section of your profile.

Whenever you start a new job, hit a milestone, or complete a project, share it on your profile! Sharing your accomplishements is so important. When you share your LinkedIn profile with potential employers, they will be able to see all the hard work you've done!

# Clubs and Activities
Joining on campus clubs can be a great way to make connections with other students and guest speakers. Thes clubs often have guest speakers who are looking for interns, research assistants, and can offer valuable advice. 

The BYU Sports Analytics Association frequently has alumni share their schooling and career experiences. They also have competitions and project prompts that can help you build your portfolio in sports analysis. At one meeting, I was able to talk with guest speaker Michael Davie, who is the Director of Strength and Conditioning at BYU Basketball! Establishing an early connection with him helped me to get my foot in the door, and part of why I landed my current internship with him!

# Professors, Advisors, and College Resources
Colleges and Departments often have both career advisors and acadmeic advisors that can help you discover resources, internships, and research opportunities to develop your skills. Your advisors are there to help!

In addition to just adding your Professors on LinkedIn, put in time to build meaningful relationships! Visit office hours, ask questions, and use their connections to find availiable research positions! I was able to get my internship directly from a relationship I have with a professor. I was taking a class from a professor that I knew does sports research. At the beginning of my Fall 2024 semester, I approached said professor about research. While he didn't have anything currently availiable, he did invite me to join a reading group where each week, someone would present a paper on a topic is sports analytics. By applying myself in his class and participating in the reading group, I was able to build a relationship with this professor. When following up with him about research opportunities, he told me about the internship with BYU Basketball, and even gave my information to the Director of Strength and Conditioning, directly reccommending me for the position. 

Without the effort I put in to meet with my professor, I would not have the internship I have today!
