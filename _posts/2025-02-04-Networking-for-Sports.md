## Data Science Student -> NBA Prospect
Roman philosopher Seneca is attributed with saying "Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity". When presented with the opportunity to work for BYU Men's Basketball, I would not have gotten the job if it wasn't for my preparation! In this post, I hope to introduce you to the biggest factors that contributed to my success!
(Feel free to read through all sections or just jump to the linked sections you are most interested in!)

I first started with [Networking](#networking)! I looked up [professors](#professors-advisors-and-college-resources) in the statistics department that did research with sports and made sure to take classes from them! At the beginning of my Fall 2024 semester, I approached my professor about research. While he didn't have anything currently available, he did invite me to join a [reading group](#clubs-and-activities) where each week, someone would present a paper on a topic is sports analytics. By applying myself in his class and participating in the reading group, I was able to build a relationship with this professor. When following up with him about research opportunities, he told me about the internship with BYU Basketball and even gave my information to the Director of Strength and Conditioning, along with a great recommendation for the position. 

In my interview for the internship with BYU Basketball, I was asked to present one of the projects on my resume! At any skill level, having a solid [portfolio](#portfolio-building) is essential! I used a class project where we focused on [data visualization](#data-visualization)! (To work on your own projects, I've included some links to [sports data](#sports-data-resources)!) I have also been told by my friend at the Sacramento Kings that [modeling](#analysis-and-modeling) is an essential skill when working for professional teams!

## Networking
Like many industries, securing a job in the realm of sports analytics relies heavily on who and what you know. There are plenty of ways to make connections, you just have to know where to look!
Starting from scratch may seem intimidating, but meeting people who are working towards similar goals or are already in your dream job will love to help anyway they can. 

#### LinkedIn
Setting up a LinkedIn profile is important for any career path, and a perfect way to make connections with people who can help you further your career. LinkedIn provides a space for you to post your accomplishments in school, personal projects, and important career events. To start your profile, visit <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>. 

Important sections to complete include:
- Profile picture and intro: Use a professional headshot for your profile picture. If you do not have one on hand, you can pose against a wall or any plain background. Your headshot only needs to include your shoulders and up, so smile! At the top of your profile, you will also want to fill out basic information to appear in your banner. You can edit the info at anytime using the pencil tool in the upper right corner.
![Intro](https://mfaulconer.github.io/Stat386-Blog/assets/img/LinkedInIntro.png)
- About: Share a brief message about your interests, goals, current projects, anything you would like to highlight!
![About](https://mfaulconer.github.io/Stat386-Blog/assets/img/LinkedInAbout.png)
- Experience: Even if you do not have a current job or internship, use this space to display your experience with companies you have previously worked with or volunteered for. Include a short description about your responsibilities and fill in the skills section! Your company and connections can verify the skills on your profile for everyone to see!
![Experience](https://mfaulconer.github.io/Stat386-Blog/assets/img/LinkedInExperience.png)
- Education: Include your estimated graduation, activities or clubs you are a part of, and any other detail relevant to your time at school. Don't forget to include your skills again!
![Education](https://mfaulconer.github.io/Stat386-Blog/assets/img/LinkedInEducation.png)

Once your profile is set up, it is time to make connections! Feel free to add anyone and everyone you know. Family, friends, roommates, professors! Expanding your range of connections will help you to unlock more potential job opportunities! You can also follow companies/schools, and they will appear under the "Interests" section of your profile.

Whenever you start a new job, hit a milestone, or complete a project, share it on your profile! Sharing your accomplishments is so important. When you share your LinkedIn profile with potential employers, they will be able to see all the hard work you've done!

#### Clubs and Activities
Joining on campus clubs can be a great way to make connections with other students and guest speakers. These clubs often have guest speakers who are looking for interns, research assistants, or can offer valuable advice. 
The BYU Sports Analytics Association frequently has alumni share their schooling and career experiences. They also have competitions and project prompts that can help you build your portfolio in sports analysis.

#### Professors, Advisors, and College Resources
Colleges and Departments often have both career advisors and academic advisors that can help you discover resources, internships, and research opportunities to develop your skills. Your advisors are there to help!
In addition to just adding your Professors on LinkedIn, put in time to build meaningful relationships! Visit office hours, ask questions, and use their connections to find available research positions!

## Portfolio Building 
While my internship focuses mostly on data visualization, I will also share some ideas on how to build experience with modeling! On the ground level, both are essential parts of building a good portfolio for sports analytics! Use this portion to gain ideas and find data to start a project now!

#### Data Visualization
The most important skill I was asked to demonstrate in my interview was data visualization, including the ability to communicate data to non-statisticians. Many athletic programs at the collegiate and professional level (including BYU Basketball) use an athlete management called <a href="https://teamworks.com/ams/" target="_blank">Smartabase</a>.
![Smartabase](https://mfaulconer.github.io/Stat386-Blog/assets/img/SmartabaseDash.png) (Typically, the rows are filled in with a mix of recorded and calculated data, but due to the private nature of player information, this photo uses test athletes who have no recorded data. This image is an example of what a dashboard on Smartabase could look like.)

When creating dashboards, we use color coding to show important data, time series graphs, player specific charts, and more. Whether or not you gain experience with Smartabase directly, having a visual portfolio is an absolute must. 

- Datawrapper: For someone with no experience, Datawrapper is a great place to start. The free version of Datawrapper includes all the options needed to create powerful visualizations. With a simple guided layout, you can easily play with formatting, coloring, and chart types.
![Datawrapper](https://mfaulconer.github.io/Stat386-Blog/assets/img/Datawrapper.png)
- Tableau: Tableau is one of the most popular data visualization software, especially in the business industry. Tableau does require a subscription, but students can receive a free version. Tableau has more complex features, which can help users to create more detailed graphics. For someone with no coding experience, Tableau is a great place to create advanced visualizations.
![Tableau](https://mfaulconer.github.io/Stat386-Blog/assets/img/Tableau.png)
- RStudio: Knowing how to use R is vital for any career in statistics, and sports is no exception. Knowing how to use R will help you to clean and organize data, perform analysis, and create visualizations all in one place. 
![RStudio](https://mfaulconer.github.io/Stat386-Blog/assets/img/RGraphs.png) (These are two of the graphs I used in the presentation for my internship interview!)

Taking classes with a focus on data visualization is a great place to start your portfolio, but you can start at anytime. The sooner you start, the better your portfolio will become, and the more skills you will have! Take the time to refine your creative skills, and make sure you can explain your findings to your target audience.

#### Analysis and Modeling
In my current internship, we do not do much analysis. When we do need to look at data on a deeper level, we use R to help coaches and training staff know where a new strategy could be applied to generate success. 
A great way to get experience is, again, during school projects. Take advantage of the fact that you would be doing a project anyway, and find a dataset that you can ask interesting questions about. Take advantage of professor feedback on these projects to help refine your basic analytic skills. Start small and work your way to larger problems that may require more complex modeling.

Two of the most common software for modeling include R and Python, and learning to use both will be helpful in pursuing any data science career. 
Many sports models utilize Bayesian statistics. Taking a Bayes class is required by many professors looking for research assistants on sports problems. 

One of the best ways to gain a better understanding of sports issues and modeling other than working directly on a research project is to read research papers. Check your local and school libraries for access to journals where you can learn more about common problems in sports. Popular journals include the "Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports" and the "Journal of Sports Analytics." The "MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference" happens yearly and is another great place to discover working papers. 
Sports modeling can be very complicated, but don't be overwhelmed. The more you engage with high level work, the better an understanding of modeling problems you will develop.

#### Sports Data Resources
Here is a list of online databases where you can access sports datasets for personal and school projects. Remember to follow the terms and conditions of websites, as taking data straight from companies like ESPN is not always permitted.
